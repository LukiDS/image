# QOI - The “Quite OK Image Format” for fast, lossless image compression

This is one of the golang versions of a En-/Decoder for the QOI - Format.

Be aware that this project is not really optimized for speed or memory usage in any way, but it gets the job done.

If speed is a concern, please save the image-file to a buffer before passing it to the En-/Decoder.

Examples and/or optimizations may be provided at a later time.
